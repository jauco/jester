The main purpose is to bundle javascript files for usage in browser.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\n\r\n* bundles [CommonJs](http://www.commonjs.org/specs/modules/1.0/) and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules. (even combined)\r\n* can create a single bundle or a bunch of chunks loaded on demand, to reduce initial loading time.\r\n* dependencies are resolved while compiling, this makes the runtime very small\r\n* loader can preprocess files while compiling, i. e. coffee-script to javascript\r\n\r\nCheck the [documentation](http://webpack.github.io/docs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=trdr) if you want to know more...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\nTake a look at the [`examples`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples) folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n## Plugins\r\n\r\nwebpack has a rich plugin interface. Most of the features are internal plugins using this interface. This makes webpack very **flexible**.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast and incredible **fast** on incremental compilation.\r\n\r\n## Loaders\r\n\r\nwebpack allows to use loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle **any static resource** not only javascript. You can easily write your own loaders running in node.js.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nwebpack supports **AMD and CommonJs** module styles. It perform clever static analysis on the AST of your code. It even has a evaluation engine to evaluate simple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries**.\r\n\r\n## Code Splitting\r\n\r\nwebpack allows to split your codebase into chunks. Chunks are loaded **on demand**. This reduces initial loading time.\r\n\r\n## Optimizations\r\n\r\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size**. It also cares about **caching** by using hashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# A small example what's possible\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nvar commonjs = require(\"./commonjs\");\r\ndefine([\"amd-module\", \"./file\"], function(amdModule, file) {\r\n\trequire([\"big-module/big/file\"], function(big) {\r\n\t\t// AMD require acts as split point\r\n\t\t// and \"big-module/big/file\" is only downloaded when requested\r\n\t\tvar stuff = require(\"../my/stuff\");\r\n\t\t// dependencies automatically goes in chunk too\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n\r\nrequire(\"coffee!./cup.coffee\");\r\n// The loader syntax allows to proprocess files\r\n// for common stuff you can bind RegExps to loaders\r\n// if you also add \".coffee\" to the default extensions\r\n// you can write:\r\nrequire(\"./cup\");\r\n\r\nfunction loadTemplate(name) {\r\n\treturn require(\"./templates/\" + name \".jade\");\r\n\t// dynamic requires are supported\r\n\t// while compiling we figure out what can be requested\r\n\t// here everything in \"./templates\" that matches /^.*\\.jade$/\r\n\t// (can also be in subdirectories)\r\n}\r\n\r\nrequire(\"imports?_=underscore!../loaders/my-ejs-loader!./template.html\");\r\n// you can chain loaders\r\n// you can configure loaders with query parameters\r\n// and loaders resolve similar to modules\r\n\r\n// ...you can combine everything\r\nfunction loadTemplateAsync(name, callback) {\r\n\trequire([\"bundle?lazy!./templates/\" + name + \".jade\"], function(templateBundle) {\r\n\t\ttemplateBundle(callback);\r\n\t});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n[documentation](http://webpack.github.io/docs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=documentation)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nYou can run the node tests with `npm test`. [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack.png)](http://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack)\r\n\r\nYou can run the browser tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd test/browsertests\r\nnode build\r\n```\r\n\r\nand open `tests.html` in browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to contribute by writing issues or pull requests.\r\nIt would be nice if you open source your own loaders or webmodules. :)\r\n\r\nYou are also welcome to correct any spelling mistakes or any language issues, because my english is not perfect...\r\n\r\nIf you want to discus something or just need help, [here is a gitter.im room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2014 Tobias Koppers\r\n\r\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sponsor\r\n\r\nThis is a freetime project. My time investment fluctuates randomly. If you use webpack for a serious task you may want me to invest more time. Or if you make some good revenue you can give some money back. Keep in mind that this project may increase your income. It makes development and applications faster and reduce the required bandwidth.\r\n\r\nI'm very thankful for every dollar. If you leave your username or email I may show my thanks by giving you extra support.\r\n\r\n[![Donate to sokra](http://img.shields.io/dontate/sokra.png)](http://sokra.github.io/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [esprima](http://esprima.org/)\r\n* [enhanced-resolve](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve)\r\n* [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)\r\n* [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha)\r\n* [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js)\r\n* [optimist](https://github.com/substack/node-optimist)\r\n* [async](https://github.com/caolan/async)\r\n* [mkdirp](http://esprima.org/)\r\n* [clone](https://github.com/pvorb/node-clone)\r\n* [base64-encode](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/base64-encode)\r\n\r\n[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack.png)](https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack)\r\n",
