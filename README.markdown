#Todo:
 * source maps end up at the wrong url '.' (setting breakpoints does work though)
 * error stacks aren't sourcemapped by themselves apparently. 
     - https://www.npmjs.org/package/stack-mapper
     - https://github.com/evanw/node-source-map-support
 * user interaction and GUI rendering tests through appthwack and Calabash.
 * rewire support (should be just a plugin away)
 * write new README.
 * Allow config options for webpack to be defined
 * Add JSX compiler
